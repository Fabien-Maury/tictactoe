It is a 2-player game. In order to win, each player needs to own 3 neighboring cells.

from 1 (bottom-left), to 9 (top-right) :
 7|8|9

 4|5|6   
 1|2|3 
 
 The game ends when one of the two players owns 3 neighboring cells,
 or when only a draw is possible.
 
 It is then possible to start a new game (y), or to leave (n).
